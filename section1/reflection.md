## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
The SuperLearner Article resonated with me in regards to reading a lot. Reading has definitely changed my life and even though I'm busier now, I make time to digest new, different information because I understand there is a lot of value in gaining information through osmosis. Strangly enough, at the moment, I'm reading Mindset by Carol S. Dweck, Ph.D, which places a lot of emphasis on having a growth mindset. Since the article was written pre-pandemic, it would be nice for it to have a section about distance learning or remote learning strategies.
